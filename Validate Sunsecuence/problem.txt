Given two non-empty arrays of intigers, write a function that determine whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjecent in the array but that are in the same order as the appear in the array. For instance, the numbers [1,3,4] from a subsequence of the array [1,2,3,4], and so do the numbrs [2,4]. Note that a single numer in an array and the array itself are both valid subsequence of the array.
